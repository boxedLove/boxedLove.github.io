# Pages

## index.html

Main page for customers; all information and marketing is designed to be here. Contains the following sections:
* Splash page - simply our logo
* Who We Are - explanation of the service, and exposing customers to our unique branding (child, mild, wild).
* Meet the Team - short bios of our team members to personify the company/service.
* Products Stocked - a few recognizable products that we stock.
* Shop - short description of our pricing model (seasonality) and link to ordering.
* Example Boxes - a couple examples of what might come in a box and the people associated with them.
* Contact - obligatory contact link to our company mailing address.

## order.html

An emulation of the form that a customer would fill out to order their box. We ask demographic questions as well as gauging their comfort/experience levels. This is the screen that a new customer would be brought to. An existing customer would not need to fill this out for every box received, but could update their responses.

## payment.html

The payment page is a familiar online page for collecting payment info and shipping/billing addresses. Notably, the page obliged customers to submit their email to create an account, for marketing purposes and for returning customers. 

## confirmation.html

Simple page thanking customers for ordering.

## evaluation.html

An emulation of the review form that an existing customer would be presented with after receiving their box. Customer feedback is powerful and helpful for the box-generation algorithm on the backend. This form collects feedback from a user about individual products, and can be used to determine whether certain products are apt for certain types of people, or whether they might be eliminated entirely.
